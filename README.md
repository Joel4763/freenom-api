Unofficial API for Renewing Freenom Free Domains

It currently gets the amount of days left for renewal, still waiting for one of my domains to near-expire to get the "submit transaction" request...

Also this method currently only works with Email/Password logins because I can't create a google login requests that are diffrent each time you reload. (I could use puppeteer to fkae the google login, but that would require a google app password as your user password each time if your using 2 Factor Auth)
